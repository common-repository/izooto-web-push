Engage your audience and drive repeat traffic by delivering relevant and personalized push notifications - across web browsers, Android, iOS and Messenger. iZooto can also automate push notifications to your audience every time you publish a new post or push out that breaking news to reclaim audience attention.

== Description ==

Over 15,000 news publishers, bloggers, enterprise media companies and content creators across the globe trust iZooto as their audience engagement platform. We enable publisher growth by helping them build, engage, grow and monetize their audience. 

iZooto helps publishers, news websites and bloggers build, engage, and [retain your audience](https://www.izooto.com/publishers) using a wide variety of push notifications such as web push notifications, app push notifications (Android and iOS), Messenger push notifications, News Hub for publishers, and even convert your AMP site visitors into your audience. 

[Web push notifications](https://www.izooto.com/web-push-notifications-explained) is a permission-based marketing channel. 
- Push notifications work across devices and form factors. They are delivered on browsers in real-time, even when your users are not on your site. 
- Notifications are targeted, and highly visible as they are delivered directly to your audience, with impressive adoption rates by end users (CTRs) that vary from 3% to 25% depending upon the editorial appeal of the notification pushed out.

[App push notifications](https://www.izooto.com/app-push-notifications-explained) on the other hand are bite-sized messages sent to users who have installed an app on their mobile device and granted permission. App push notifications are rapidly evolving into a rich and interactive medium.

[Messenger push notifications](https://www.izooto.com/facebook-messenger-push-notifications-definitive-guide) help build and engage your audience on Facebook Messenger. Facebook has more than 1 billion active users, giving you an opportunity to tap into that audience and engage them at your will.

[News Hub](https://www.izooto.com/news-hub-personalized-notification-inbox-for-your-website) is a personalized notification inbox for your website. It provides you with amazing shelf life, that enables readers to interact with push notifications directly from your website whenever they want to. More the clicks, more the page views and more the revenue. 

[iZooto](https://www.izooto.com/publishers) helps you accomplish 3 key objectives: 
1. [Build your marketing list](https://www.izooto.com/blog/custom-audiences-audience-builder): **Convert your website and AMP site visitors to your audience**. With an opt-in rate of up to 7%, you can build a list 30 times faster than email. 
2. [Understand your audience](https://www.izooto.com/blog/understanding-target-audience): **Segment** your audience based on their location, on-site behaviour, device, and more and [improve customer retention](https://www.izooto.com/retention-playbooks)
3. [Engage and monetize](https://www.izooto.com/blog/publishers/how-to-monetize-a-website) - **Send targeted notifications** to your audience and drive engagement. Publishers can grow their traffic and monetize their audience by opting in to send ads via push notifications.
